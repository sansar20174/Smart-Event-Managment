## ⚙️ How It Works
### ➕ Add Event

User fills the form and clicks Add Event

Event is added dynamically into the "My Events" section as a card

### ❌ Delete Event

Each event card has an X button

Clicking it removes that event card

### 🧹 Clear Events

Clicking Clear Events removes all events from the list

### 📝 Add Sample Events

Clicking Add Sample Events automatically adds two pre-defined events

### ⌨️ DOM Output

If you press any key, the system displays:

Key Pressed: <key-name>
